**Now that the LocalSearch API has been deprecated, what's next?**

Google announced the deprecation of the LocalSearch API, which is at the heart of the GoogleBar, on 1 November 2010. According to their deprecation policy, they will make all reasonable efforts to maintain the service for three years from that date, meaning that the LocalSearch API will be finally discontinued no earlier than 1 November 2013. Looking down the road, Google has stated that the new Places API (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/places/) will ultimately succeed the LocalSearch API. At this time, however, the Places API remains in a limited developer preview and does not yet support the same sort of keyword search functionality provided by the LocalSearch API. For that reason, gmaps-api-v3-googlebar will continue to utilize the LocalSearch API until the Places API offers comparable functionality or the LocalSearch API is discontinued.

**How many Googlers work on this project?**

The short answer is: none at this time. But Googlers would, of course, be welcome to contribute if they so choose.
